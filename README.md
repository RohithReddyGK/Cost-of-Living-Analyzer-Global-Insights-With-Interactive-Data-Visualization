# Cost of Living Analyzer: Global Insights with Interactive Data Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Cost of Living Analyzer** is a web-based application designed to help users compare the cost of living in different cities and countries worldwide. It provides **interactive visualizations** of key expense factors such as housing, transportation, food, utilities, and more.

The project leverages **React.js & Tailwind CSS for frontend**, **Django for backend**, and **BeautifulSoup & Pandas for data extraction and processing**. The application also incorporates **Chart.js** for visualizing cost-of-living trends dynamically.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Compare Cities & Countries**: Users can compare the cost of living across different locations.
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Uses charts, graphs, and maps for clear insights.
- **Real-time Data Scraping**: Extracts and processes data from trusted sources.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Shows trends over multiple years.
- **User-friendly UI**: Responsive design for seamless browsing on different devices.
- **Search & Filtering**: Users can search cities/countries and filter cost components.

## 📥 Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/RohithReddyGK/Cost-of-Living-Analyzer-Global-Insights-With-Interactive-Data-Visualization.git
 cd Cost-of-Living-Analyzer-Global-Insights-With-Interactive-Data-Visualization
```

### **2️⃣ Setup Backend (Django)**
```sh
cd backend
python -m venv env  # Create virtual environment
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
python manage.py migrate  # Apply database migrations
python manage.py runserver  # Start the Django server
```

### **3️⃣ Setup Frontend (React.js)**
```sh
cd ../frontend
npm install  # Install dependencies
npm start  # Start the React development server
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000/` and the backend API on `http://localhost:8000/`.

---

## 📖 Usage Guide
1. Open the **React frontend** in your browser (`http://localhost:3000/`).
2. Use the search bar to enter a city or country.
3. Select the metric (e.g., Cost of Living Index, Rent Index, etc.).
4. View **dynamic graphs & comparisons**.
5. Compare cost trends between two locations.

---

## 📊 Data Sources & Methodology
The cost-of-living data is **scraped from trusted sources**.
Data is processed using **BeautifulSoup & Pandas**, ensuring accuracy before visualization.
